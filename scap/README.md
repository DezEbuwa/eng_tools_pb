Creating a GitLab CI/CD pipeline that runs an OpenSCAP (Open Security Content Automation Protocol) scan against a Windows target and publishes the results using GitLab Pages involves several steps. Below is a basic example of how this can be set up. This example assumes you have a basic understanding of GitLab CI/CD, GitLab Pages, and OpenSCAP. It also assumes you have the necessary permissions to execute commands on the Windows target.

### Step 1: Preparing Your Environment

1. **OpenSCAP for Windows**: Ensure that OpenSCAP is installed and properly configured on your Windows target. Currently, OpenSCAP's primary support is for Linux-based systems, but you can use the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or a similar solution to run OpenSCAP on Windows.

2. **GitLab Runner Configuration**: Ensure you have a GitLab Runner configured to run jobs in your pipeline. This runner can be set up on a Linux machine that has network access to your Windows target. If you're using WSL on the Windows target, you might be able to set up the runner directly on it.

3. **SSH Access**: Ensure you have SSH access set up from your GitLab Runner host to your Windows target for executing commands remotely.

### Step 2: Writing the `.gitlab-ci.yml` File

Create or edit the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your GitLab repository to define the pipeline. The following is a simplified example of what the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file might look like:

```yaml
stages:
  - scan
  - publish

scan_windows:
  stage: scan
  script:
    - ssh user@windows-target "wsl oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_standard --report /var/www/html/report.html /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-windows-ds.xml"
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - report.html
    expire_in: 1 week
  only:
    - main

publish:
  stage: publish
  dependencies:
    - scan_windows
  script:
    - mkdir public
    - mv report.html public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
    expire_in: 1 week
  only:
    - main
  pages:
    stage: publish
    script:
      - mv report.html public/
    artifacts:
      paths:
        - public
```

### Explanation:

- **Stages**: Defined two stages, `scan` for running the OpenSCAP scan and `publish` for publishing the results.
- **scan_windows Job**: This job connects to the Windows target via SSH and runs the OpenSCAP scan using WSL. Replace `user@windows-target` with your actual SSH connection details and adjust the OpenSCAP command as needed. The output report is saved as an artifact.
- **publish Job**: This job takes the report generated by the `scan_windows` job, moves it into the `public/` directory (required by GitLab Pages), and publishes it to GitLab Pages.

### Step 3: Configuring GitLab Pages

Ensure your GitLab project is configured to use GitLab Pages. The `publish` job in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file automatically makes the `public/` directory available as a static website.

### Final Notes:

- This example uses SSH to execute a command remotely on a Windows target. Make sure the user you're using for SSH has the necessary permissions to run OpenSCAP scans.
- The OpenSCAP command provided is just an example. You'll need to adjust it based on the specific scan you want to perform and the profiles you're using.
- The GitLab Runner executing this pipeline needs to have SSH access configured to the target machine. This might involve setting up SSH keys and ensuring the runner's user has permission to use SSH.

This is a basic template to get you started. Depending on your specific requirements, environment, and security policies, you may need to make adjustments.
