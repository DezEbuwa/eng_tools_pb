Perfect. Based on the stage description and your listed features, here are paragraph-style descriptions for each one, written to fit neatly into a JIRA backlog or feature list. Let me know if you'd like these broken out into user story format later.

---

### **Develop Azure Identity and Access Management Features**  
Design and implement Terraform-based modules to automate Azure IAM provisioning. This includes role-based access control (RBAC), custom role definitions, service principal creation, and identity federation where applicable. These templates will standardize identity and permission structures, reduce manual configuration errors, and improve auditability across all classified environments using Azure.

---

### **Develop Azure Policy Integration**  
Create IaC modules that integrate Azure Policy for enforcing compliance rules and governance across cloud environments. This will include the deployment of built-in and custom policies, as well as their assignment to key scopes such as management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. These policies will ensure that all infrastructure deployed via the CDF adheres to security and operational standards automatically.

---

### **Build Azure Storage Management Functionality**  
Develop reusable Terraform modules for provisioning and managing Azure storage resources, including storage accounts, containers, and lifecycle management rules. The implementation will support tagging, encryption, and private endpoints, ensuring that storage solutions meet classified environment security requirements while remaining scalable and efficient.

---

### **Develop/Finalize Azure-specific Terraform Modules**  
Consolidate and refine a library of modular, reusable Terraform components tailored for Azure services. These modules will support consistent provisioning of compute, networking, IAM, and storage services, and will follow best practices for maintainability, versioning, and security. These modules will form the foundation of the Azure-specific deployment workflows.

---

### **Finalize AVD Templates with All Client Tools**  
Complete the development of fully-configured Azure Virtual Desktop (AVD) templates. These templates will include all required client tools, compliance hardening scripts, and user environment configurations to support standardized, secure desktop deployments. Delivered via IaC, the templates will enable rapid and consistent provisioning of AVD instances in air-gapped environments.

---

### **Draft AWS IAM Features**  
Begin development of Terraform templates to provision AWS IAM roles, users, and policies. The focus will be on establishing a baseline for secure identity management in classified AWS environments, aligning with zero-trust and least-privilege principles while supporting cross-account and service-level permissions where needed.

---

### **Draft AWS Networking Configuration Capabilities**  
Design draft templates for provisioning AWS networking resources including VPCs, subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, and security groups. These foundational templates will provide a consistent, secure starting point for deploying infrastructure into AWS and support future integration with classified networking and peering requirements.

---

### **Define AWS Storage Management Functionality**  
Outline and prototype the approach for managing AWS storage via Terraform, including S3 buckets, EBS volumes, and associated encryption and access policies. This feature sets the groundwork for fully automated storage provisioning in secure AWS environments with attention to data integrity, access control, and lifecycle policies.

---

### **Implement AWS-specific Deployment Templates**  
Develop initial versions of deployment templates tailored for AWS using Terraform. These templates will automate the creation of standard infrastructure patterns, including IAM, networking, and compute resources, ensuring alignment with both the broader framework architecture and classified environment requirements.

---

### **Develop AWS Config Integration**  
Build Terraform-compatible configurations for enabling and managing AWS Config, ensuring that deployed resources are continuously monitored for compliance with organizational baselines. This feature will allow Ops teams to detect drift and enforce configuration standards automatically across air-gapped AWS environments.

Let me know if you'd like to group these into epics, add acceptance criteria, or align them to a particular Jira formatting style (e.g., story/task/initiative hierarchy).
