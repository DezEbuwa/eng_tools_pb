Here are the JIRA-ready feature descriptions for the **"Documentation and Training"** stage of your CDF development plan. These descriptions are structured to align with the stage goals and provide clarity on purpose, scope, and value:

---

### **Develop User Documentation**  
Create comprehensive user documentation that guides administrators and operators through the installation, configuration, and day-to-day management of the CDF. This documentation will include step-by-step instructions, annotated examples, and operational tips for managing deployments, configuring components, and monitoring performance in classified and air-gapped environments. The documentation will be tailored to support both initial onboarding and long-term usability.

---

### **Produce Deployment Pattern Cookbooks**  
Develop a set of deployment pattern cookbooks that provide curated examples of common deployment scenarios—such as web applications, databases, and internal APIs. These cookbooks will include pre-defined templates, step-by-step instructions, and flow diagrams showing how to navigate through the framework. Users will be able to follow standard paths or adapt them to their specific environments, supporting both standardization and flexibility in classified deployments.

---

### **Document Terraform Module Usage and Standards**  
Produce detailed documentation on the structure, usage, and lifecycle management of Terraform modules within the CDF. This will include guidance on naming conventions, input/output variables, version control, and module reusability. The goal is to ensure that all Terraform components are consistent, maintainable, and aligned with organizational standards for secure infrastructure provisioning.

---

### **Develop Ansible Playbook and Role Documentation and Standards**  
Create documentation that outlines how to develop, structure, and apply Ansible playbooks and roles within the framework. This includes naming conventions, role reuse, variable management, tagging, and idempotency expectations. The documentation will ensure that playbooks are easy to understand, scalable, and maintainable, supporting effective configuration management in secure, disconnected environments.

---

### **Create IaC Best Practices Guide for Air-Gapped Environments**  
Develop a comprehensive guide that outlines best practices for developing and managing Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) within air-gapped environments. Topics will include secure module development, bundle packaging, SBOM integration, policy enforcement, and offline deployment validation. This guide will serve as both a reference and a governance artifact to ensure that all IaC used in classified environments meets operational, security, and regulatory requirements.

Let me know if you'd like these formatted as JIRA stories with acceptance criteria or aligned to your existing epics and workflow tags. I can also help you build a documentation site structure or Confluence layout if you’re planning to host this content internally.
