Absolutely! Here's a detailed breakdown of your development framework with two channelsâ€”**Proposed** and **Approved**â€”along with a flow diagram concept.

### ðŸ”§ **Framework Overview**

#### **1. Channels Definition**

* **Proposed Channel**

  * Purpose: For initial code commits, feature development, and unapproved artifacts.
  * GitLab Branches: `proposed/main`, `feature/*`
  * Nexus Repositories: `proposed-snapshots`, `proposed-releases`

* **Approved Channel**

  * Purpose: For vetted, security-reviewed, and production-ready code and artifacts.
  * GitLab Branches: `approved/main`
  * Nexus Repositories: `approved-releases`

### ðŸ”„ **End-to-End Workflow**

#### **Step-by-Step Flow**

1. **Development in Proposed**

   * Devs push to `feature/*` branches.
   * Merge Requests target `proposed/main`.
   * GitLab CI/CD builds artifacts and publishes to `proposed-snapshots` or `proposed-releases`.

2. **Review & Validation**

   * Code Review (Peer + Security/DevSecOps)
   * SBOM & Vulnerability Scanning
   * QA Testing / Automated Unit & Integration Tests

3. **Approval Process**

   * If all checks pass, project lead or release manager tags the commit for promotion.
   * GitLab pipeline triggers a promotion job.

4. **Migration to Approved**

   * Code:

     * Tag or cherry-pick into `approved/main`
   * Artifacts:

     * Promote from `proposed-*` to `approved-releases` (via Nexus staging/promote task or CI job)

5. **Post-Approval CI/CD**

   * Optional re-build from `approved/main` to verify integrity.
   * Deploy to staging/production environments.
   * Artifacts signed and versioned.

### ðŸ“Š **Flow Diagram**

I'll describe the components, then generate a diagram.

#### **Diagram Components**

* **GitLab (SCM)**:

  * `feature/*` â†’ `proposed/main` â†’ (merge review) â†’ `approved/main`
* **CI/CD Pipeline**:

  * Build â†’ Test â†’ SBOM Scan â†’ QA â†’ Promote
* **Nexus (Artifact Repo)**:

  * `proposed-snapshots` / `proposed-releases`
  * â†’ `approved-releases`
