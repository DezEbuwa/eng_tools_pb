Here are feature descriptions for the **"Testing and Validation"** stage of your CDF deployment framework plan. These are written as clear, professional paragraphs suitable for JIRA feature stories, with a focus on clarity, traceability, and secure deployment validation.

---

### **Develop Automated Testing Framework**  
Design and implement an automated testing framework to verify the correctness of deployed infrastructure components. This framework will use code-based test cases to validate connectivity, configurations, and service availability across deployed environments. It will provide a consistent, repeatable method to detect issues early in the deployment lifecycle and support scalable validation across multiple platforms.

---

### **Implement CITE for Deployment Validation**  
Stand up and configure the Common Integrated Test Environment (CITE) to serve as the central environment for validating deployment workflows. The CITE will host controlled infrastructure for conducting realistic, end-to-end tests of the deployment process, allowing teams to simulate production-like conditions, uncover integration issues, and ensure system behavior aligns with expectations.

---

### **Build Security Testing Capabilities**  
Integrate automated security testing tools to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the deployed infrastructure. This capability will assess compliance with internal and external security standards, detect known vulnerabilities (e.g., via SBOM scans or configuration audits), and support continuous assurance of classified deployment environments.

---

### **Implement Terraform Plan Validation Tools**  
Create tooling to automatically review and validate `terraform plan` outputs for unexpected changes, policy violations, or security risks. These tools will be embedded into CI/CD pipelines to prevent unauthorized or misaligned infrastructure changes from reaching runtime environments, ensuring policy-as-code and security governance are enforced pre-deployment.

---

### **Create IaC Validation Tools**  
Develop validation tools to perform static and dynamic analysis of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) templates. These tools will verify syntax, module structure, and adherence to best practices across Terraform and Ansible codebases. Results will be integrated into pipeline workflows to enforce code quality and prevent drift from organizational standards.

---

### **Perform Security Assessments**  
Conduct manual and automated security assessments on deployed environments and CI/CD workflows. These assessments will focus on identity access controls, network boundaries, system hardening, and code pipeline security, providing assurance that both the deployment process and its outcomes are secure and compliant with classified environment policies.

---

### **Execute Deployment Scenario Testing**  
Run predefined deployment scenarios in both normal and edge-case conditions to validate the resilience and correctness of the framework under a variety of use cases. This will include testing supported configurations, error conditions, and platform variations to ensure broad coverage and identify systemic issues early in the development cycle.

---

### **Test Failure Recovery Scenarios**  
Develop and execute tests to simulate failure events—such as interrupted provisioning, broken dependencies, or infrastructure misconfigurations—and evaluate the framework’s ability to recover. These tests will validate rollback mechanisms, retry logic, and Ops readiness, strengthening the reliability of the CDF in production use.

---

### **Validate Air-Gap Functionality**  
Verify that all components of the deployment framework function reliably within air-gapped environments. This includes testing offline compatibility for infrastructure provisioning, artifact delivery, and pipeline operations using tools like Syft, Hoppr, Droppr, and Nexus. The goal is to ensure no external dependencies remain in secure zones.

---

### **Perform Terraform State Consistency Testing**  
Implement automated checks to validate the integrity and consistency of Terraform state files. This will include testing for orphaned resources, state drift, and lock handling to ensure deployments reflect actual infrastructure and are protected against corruption during concurrent access or failures.

---

### **Conduct Idempotency Testing for Ansible Playbooks**  
Test Ansible playbooks across multiple runs to ensure idempotency—verifying that repeated executions result in no unexpected changes. This ensures stable and predictable behavior across re-deployments and remediation operations, improving the reliability and maintainability of operational automation.

---

### **Validate IaC Security Best Practices**  
Review and validate IaC templates against recognized security best practices, such as enforcing least privilege, resource tagging, secure defaults, and secrets management. Validation will include static scans and peer-reviewed checklists to ensure all code deployed through the CDF adheres to secure development lifecycle (SDLC) principles.
