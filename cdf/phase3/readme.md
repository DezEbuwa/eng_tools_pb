Here are JIRA-ready feature descriptions for the **"IaC for Air-Gapped Environments"** stage of your CDF framework. Each paragraph aligns with your phase objectives and emphasizes automation, traceability, and secure deployment in IL4 environments and beyond.

---

### **Requirements Bundle and Migration Tool**  
Develop and refine the use of Hoppr to package deployment requirements—such as artifacts, IaC templates, software dependencies, and configurations—into portable bundles for air-gapped delivery. This feature will support the consistent and secure transfer of approved assets into IL4 environments, enabling efficient deployment workflows without relying on external network access.

---

### **Requirements Bundle Verification Mechanism**  
Create a verification mechanism using Droppr to validate the integrity, completeness, and readiness of requirement bundles once migrated into the air-gapped environment. This feature ensures that all necessary components are correctly installed and configured, preventing incomplete or misconfigured deployments that could impact availability or security.

---

### **Deployment Verification with RunIT**  
Integrate RunIT to validate infrastructure and application deployments within the air-gapped environment. This includes automating post-deployment tests, verifying successful provisioning, and ensuring key services are operational. This feature ensures continuous assurance of deployment integrity in environments where troubleshooting access is limited.

---

### **Ongoing Maintenance Plan with RunIT**  
Establish a repeatable maintenance framework using RunIT to schedule and manage recurring infrastructure tasks such as updates, system checks, and log rotations. This plan will ensure long-term reliability and security of the deployed environments, reducing the operational burden on Ops teams working in isolated environments.

---

### **IaC Library Integration with RunIT**  
Connect the previously consolidated IaC collection to RunIT workflows to support provisioning and orchestration of infrastructure components. This feature will enable deployment operators to invoke trusted Terraform modules and Ansible playbooks within the air-gapped environment using approved and version-controlled IaC.

---

### **Security Scanning of Deployments with RunIT**  
Enable automated security scanning jobs in RunIT to assess deployed infrastructure for misconfigurations, known vulnerabilities, and policy violations. These scans will leverage SBOMs and configuration baselines to detect drift or exposure, reinforcing classified deployment security standards in IL4 environments.

---

### **Implement State Management for Air-Gapped Environments**  
Design and deploy a robust state management solution for Terraform in air-gapped environments, ensuring accurate tracking of provisioned resources. This feature will include local or private remote backends (e.g., S3-compatible storage with locking support) and ensure that concurrent access, recovery, and auditability are handled securely and efficiently.

Let me know if you'd like these grouped under epics like "RunIT Integration" or "Bundle Management," or formatted into user stories with acceptance criteria.
