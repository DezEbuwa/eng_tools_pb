Creating an Ansible playbook to upload Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) artifacts to a Nexus repository involves several steps. This playbook will use the Nexus Repository Manager API to upload the files. Make sure you have the required permissions and the API is enabled on your Nexus server.

Here's a basic playbook that demonstrates how to do this:

```yaml
---
- name: Upload SBOM artifacts to Nexus Repository
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: no
  vars:
    nexus_url: "http://your-nexus-server/repository/your-sbom-repo/"
    nexus_user: "admin"
    nexus_password: "admin123"
    sbom_files_directory: "/path/to/sbom/artifacts"

  tasks:
    - name: Find SBOM files
      ansible.builtin.find:
        paths: "{{ sbom_files_directory }}"
        patterns: '*.sbom'
      register: sbom_files

    - name: Upload SBOM files to Nexus
      ansible.builtin.uri:
        url: "{{ nexus_url }}{{ item.path | basename }}"
        method: PUT
        user: "{{ nexus_user }}"
        password: "{{ nexus_password }}"
        force_basic_auth: yes
        body: "{{ lookup('file', item.path) }}"
        headers:
          Content-Type: "application/json"
      loop: "{{ sbom_files.files }}"
      register: upload_results

    - name: Check upload results
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Uploaded {{ item.item.path | basename }} with status {{ item.status }}"
      loop: "{{ upload_results.results }}"
```

### Breakdown of the Playbook
1. **Variables:**
   - `nexus_url`: URL of the Nexus repository where the SBOM files should be uploaded.
   - `nexus_user` and `nexus_password`: Credentials for Nexus. It's recommended to use Ansible Vault to encrypt these credentials in a production environment.
   - `sbom_files_directory`: Local directory path where SBOM files are stored.

2. **Tasks:**
   - **Find SBOM files:** This task uses the `find` module to locate all `.sbom` files within the specified directory.
   - **Upload SBOM files to Nexus:** The `uri` module is used for making HTTP requests. It uploads each SBOM file found by the previous task to the Nexus repository. The `basename` filter is used to extract the filename from the full path for use in the URL.
   - **Check upload results:** This task uses the `debug` module to print the upload status of each file.

### Considerations
- Ensure that the Nexus repository accepts the content type you're uploading. The example uses `application/json`, but you might need to change this depending on the format of your SBOM files.
- Securely handle Nexus credentials using Ansible Vault or another secrets management tool.
- If your files are not JSON, adjust the `Content-Type` header accordingly.
- This playbook is designed to run locally as it interacts with a remote API. Adjust `hosts` if you need to run it from another machine.

This is a basic template and might need modifications based on your specific Nexus configuration and SBOM file formats.
