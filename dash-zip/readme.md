To zip your site folder (`dist`) and save it as an artifact in a GitLab CI pipeline, follow these steps:

---

### ✅ 1. Update your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

Add a job that zips the `dist` folder and stores it as an artifact. Here's a minimal working example:

```yaml
stages:
  - build

package_site:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Zipping dist folder"
    - zip -r site.zip dist/
  artifacts:
    name: "site-artifact"
    paths:
      - site.zip
    expire_in: 1 week
```

---

### 📝 Notes:
- `zip -r site.zip dist/` recursively zips the contents of the `dist` folder.
- The artifact will be downloadable from the GitLab job's UI.
- `expire_in` sets how long the artifact is retained. You can change it (e.g., `2 days`, `never`).

---

### 💡 Optional: Include only the *contents* of `dist` in the ZIP

If you don’t want the `dist/` folder itself in the zip, only its contents:

```bash
cd dist && zip -r ../site.zip . && cd ..
```

Update the `script` section to:

```yaml
script:
  - cd dist && zip -r ../site.zip . && cd ..
```

---

Let me know if you want to trigger this after a build step or include versioning in the artifact name.
