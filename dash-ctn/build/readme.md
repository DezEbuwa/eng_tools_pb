Yes, it's **absolutely possible** to containerize your Angular + FastAPI + SQLite3 application into a **single Podman image** and automate builds/pushes using a **GitLab pipeline** that pushes to **Harbor**.

Here’s a high-level breakdown of how you can do it:

---

### ✅ 1. **Project Structure**
You can structure your repo like this:

```
my-app/
├── frontend/           # Angular 19 app
├── backend/            # FastAPI app (main.py, etc.)
├── database/           # Optional initial SQLite DB file
├── Dockerfile          # For full-stack container
├── .gitlab-ci.yml      # GitLab pipeline config
└── ...
```

---

### ✅ 2. **Single Container Dockerfile (Podman-compatible)**

```Dockerfile
# Build Angular frontend
FROM node:20 as frontend-builder
WORKDIR /app/frontend
COPY frontend/ .
RUN npm install && npm run build

# Build FastAPI backend with SQLite
FROM python:3.11-slim as backend
WORKDIR /app

# Copy backend and install dependencies
COPY backend/ /app/backend
COPY database/ /app/database  # If you have a prebuilt .sqlite3 file
RUN pip install fastapi uvicorn[standard]

# Copy frontend build into backend static folder
COPY --from=frontend-builder /app/frontend/dist/ /app/backend/static/

# Expose the FastAPI app
WORKDIR /app/backend
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
```

✅ Make sure `main.py` in FastAPI is serving the Angular build using `StaticFiles`.

---

### ✅ 3. **.gitlab-ci.yml (Using Podman and Push to Harbor)**

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - push

variables:
  IMAGE_NAME: harbor.example.com/myproject/my-app

build:
  stage: build
  image: quay.io/podman/stable
  script:
    - podman build -t $IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA .
    - podman tag $IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA $IMAGE_NAME:latest
    - podman login harbor.example.com -u $HARBOR_USERNAME -p $HARBOR_PASSWORD
    - podman push $IMAGE_NAME:$CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA
    - podman push $IMAGE_NAME:latest
```

**Secrets:**
- Store `$HARBOR_USERNAME` and `$HARBOR_PASSWORD` in **GitLab CI/CD variables**.

---

### ✅ 4. **Serving Angular via FastAPI (example)**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.responses import FileResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Serve Angular dist folder
app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="static", html=True), name="static")

# Optional: catch-all to serve index.html for Angular routes
@app.get("/{full_path:path}")
async def serve_vue_app():
    return FileResponse("static/index.html")
```

---

### ✅ 5. **SQLite**
SQLite works well in a container as long as:
- The `.sqlite3` file is in the container and has appropriate read/write permissions.
- If you want persistent data across container runs, mount a volume.

---

### ⚠️ Notes
- Podman can run in rootless mode, and in GitLab it often runs in rootless containers. You might need to tweak permissions or use `--storage-driver=vfs` in the GitLab job if needed.
- If you're using a remote runner, ensure Podman is installed and has access to the required storage/network features.
